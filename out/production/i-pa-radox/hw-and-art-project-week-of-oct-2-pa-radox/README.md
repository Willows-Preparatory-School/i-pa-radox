Here is a repository for uploading all of your AP Computer Science homework and files.

We'll create a new repository every week. However, the teaching team will be grading assignments **after they are due (not weekly)**. E.g., at the end of class on Monday, homework is assigned. You need to complete the homework and **push the changes to your repository by class** on Tuesday.
Then, one of the teaching team will grade it before Friday, and your grade will be updated in MySchool.  

You might create a text file for your answers to non-coding problems. For example, your answers to self-check problems will likely be a .txt or .docx file. You might upload your Growth Portfolio in the future here, as well.
